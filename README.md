# Happy Mask Shop

This is a web application inspired by "The Happy Mask Shop" from the Zelda games "The Ocarina of Time" and "Majora's Mask". These are two of my absolute favorite games of all time and this application is a tribute to the shop location in "Ocarina of Time" and the mask collecting story-line of "Majora's Mask". It uses the model "masks" and has complete CRUD data operations on this data entity.
